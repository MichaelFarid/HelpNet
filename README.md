# HelpNet
Since there is a sharp increase in the number of natural disasters in today's world, emergency medical services are needed more than ever. Also, while governmental and private emergency responders do an amazing job at rescuing people and helping people in drastic medical conditions, they can not always tend to the needs of everyone in need of them in a timely fashion. Therefore, we thought that a citizen approach to providing emergency services in drastic situations would yield to a more timely service and therefore a higher survival rate.

The app connects CPR and EMT certified individuals and people who possess an AED, EpiPen, Narcan or insulin to people in medical emergencies requiring such help or resources to provide a more timely service when professional services are not readily available. It also connects EMTs to citizens in need with a chat interface if necessary.
